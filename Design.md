## Main Spinner

The main spinner is a 3 reel spinner with 5 symbols per reel
Depending on which row has a three-in-a-row match, your multiplier changes

## Pity Spinner

For every spin that doesn't result in a win you get a 10% increase to your pity spinner
At 100% you get to spin at the pity spinner
The pity spinner has 2 reels so it's easier to win on it
